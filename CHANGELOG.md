- Security policy and best practices
- Contributing guidelines
- API documentation
- Installation and troubleshooting guides

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV 4.8+
- Open3D 0.17+
- Flask 2.3+
- SciPy 1.11+
- NumPy 1.24+
- scikit-learn 1.3+
- laspy 2.5+

### Known Issues
- Large image sets (200+ images) may require significant memory (8GB+)
- Bundle adjustment processing time increases quadratically with image count
- macOS may show GUI warnings for Open3D visualization (uses matplotlib fallback)

### Performance Characteristics
| Images | Processing Time | Memory Usage | Point Cloud Size |
|--------|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| 2-10   | 30s-2min      | 1-2GB       | 1K-5K points    |
| 10-50  | 2-10min       | 2-4GB       | 5K-20K points   |
| 50+    | 10min+        | 4-8GB+      | 20K+ points     |
